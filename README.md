# Scan To Terminal

A macro was developed by a third party to automatically create & print labels when carton barcodes were scanned. This information was then manually entered into the inventory management system.


## The Solution

A python application was created to automate the data entry into the inventory management system while the scanning process is ongoing. The inventory system is accessible via a web terminal.
